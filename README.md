# Odd and Even Numbers Printer

This is a simple C++ program that prints odd and even numbers up to 100.

## How It Works
- The program starts with an odd number (1) and an even number (2).
- It prints odd and even numbers alternately until both reach 100.
- The program uses a `while` loop to iterate through the numbers.

## Code Structure
- `oddeven(int x, int y)`: A function that takes two integers and prints odd and even numbers up to 100.
- `main()`: Calls the `oddeven` function with initial values of 1 (odd) and 2 (even).

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler like g++:
   ```sh
   g++ -o oddeven oddeven.cpp
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./oddeven
   ```

## Expected Output
```
Odd num: 1
Even num: 2
Odd num: 3
Even num: 4
...
Odd num: 99
Even num: 100
```

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC).
- Basic knowledge of C++.
